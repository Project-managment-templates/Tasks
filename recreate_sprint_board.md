# Recreate sprint board

### Prerequisites
* Currently beta projects are only available for organisations. So you must have an organisation setup. 

### Steps

 1. [Optional] create a private repo to store all your issues in. Alternatively you could store your issues in your existing repos. 
 2. Create a new [project.](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/creating-a-project)
 3. Using the `table view` start by adding the following columns
 4. Status column represents the current status of the issue 
 5. Add a column for Labels, these are the traditional issue Labels, which I suggest you use to differentiate the type of issue (bug, feature request)     
 6. Add a new single select field for epics. Add all your epics
 7. Add a number field for story points 
 8. Add a Sprint field 
 9. Finally, group the board by sprints for a better view 
 10. If you wish, you can duplicate the view and save as board to easily switch between the two views.
